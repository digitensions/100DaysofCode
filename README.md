#100DaysofCode
Python scripts and unit tests written during my #100DaysofCode challenge.

This repository contains python3 script(s) written by Joanna White. I'm learning Python having worked more extensively with BASH shell. Wherever possible these Python modules will be heavily commented to help my continued development (and recall!), and for any individuals wishing to read or test them. Please note these are TRAINING SCRIPTS written just for fun, and will require further development and testing.

I've opted to work with PyUnit's unittest for testing modules as it's part of Python's standard library and I'll add more as the #100DaysofCode extends.

Comments, feedback and collaboration welcomed :)

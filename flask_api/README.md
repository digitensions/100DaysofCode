### To use these API scripts you will need to install Python3 and Flask.

## python api_local.py
Navigate to this address using a browser once the script is running:
`127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/resources/books/all`
This script calls on a script dictionary of my current reading materials (don't judge me)!
You can separately view each dictionary entry (displayed in JSON) by using ?id=1:
`127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/resources/books?id=1`

## python api_database.py
This script needs the books.db file in the same directory alongside it.
Again you can navigate to the following link (don't try to run these two script together):
`127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/resources/books/all`
In addition you can set queries using id, author, publication:
`127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/resources/books?publication=2010`
`127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/resources/books?author=China Mieville`

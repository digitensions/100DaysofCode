#100DaysofCode
Python scripts and unit tests written during my #100DaysofCode challenge.

This repository contains python3 script(s) written by Joanna White. Wherever possible these will be heavily notated to help my continued Python development (and recall!), and for any individuals wishing to read or test them. Please note these are TRAINING SCRIPTS written just for fun, and will require further development and testing.

I hope to add more as the #100DaysofCode extends and welcome any comments, feedback and collaboration.

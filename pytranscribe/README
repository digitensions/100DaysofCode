You can try running this code by using my personal ASSEMBLYAI account API token and upload/transcript UIs:
You don't need to run upload_audio_file.py unless you want to try another.

Run this in your venv before running any of the AssemblyAI scripts:
`export ASSEMBLYAI_KEY=3536b3aba82942d3b427c310a9672e49`

To run another transcription use:
`python3 initiate_transcription.py 7aa20292-0c84-4593-ad0b-32391987265b`

To download the get_transcription, create a transcription.txt file and change the path in the script, then run:
`python3 get_transcription.py g1nw0m0qs-ce85-4d25-8a6f-96786f0eed88`

I made a quick word_sort_count.py script that sorts the results into words. I'd prefer a filter for most numbers listed first,
so I'll maybe update this in days to come.

Please be kind if you use my AssemblyAI log in.
